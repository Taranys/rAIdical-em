## Customizable comment categories

**Origin:** Phase 2 planning
**Context:** The initial set of 8 review comment categories (Bug/correctness, Security, Performance, Readability/maintainability, Nitpick/style, Architecture/design, Missing test/coverage, Question/clarification) is hardcoded. In the future, allow engineering managers to add, rename, or remove categories to match their team's review culture.
