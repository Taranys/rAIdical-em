# US-023: Application Shell and Navigation

**Phase:** 1 — GitHub Integration
**Status:** Todo

## Story

As an engineering manager, I want a clean sidebar navigation so that I can easily move between dashboard, team, and settings pages.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] A persistent sidebar wraps all pages with navigation links to: Dashboard, Team, Settings
- [ ] The current page is visually highlighted in the sidebar
- [ ] The layout is responsive (works on laptop screens; mobile is not required)
- [ ] The app title "em-control-tower" is visible in the sidebar

## Dependencies

None — this is the foundational story for Phase 1.
