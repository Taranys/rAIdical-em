# US-023: Application Shell and Navigation

**Phase:** 1 — GitHub Integration
**Status:** Todo

## Story

As an engineering manager, I want a clean navigation layout with sidebar or top nav so that I can easily move between dashboard, team, and settings pages.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] A persistent layout wraps all pages with navigation links to: Dashboard, Team, Settings
- [ ] The current page is visually highlighted in the navigation
- [ ] The layout is responsive (works on laptop screens; mobile is not required)
- [ ] The app title "em-control-tower" is visible in the header/sidebar
