# US-001: Define Product Vision

**Phase:** 0 — Project Setup
**Status:** Done

## Story

As an engineering manager, I want a clear product vision document so that all future contributors understand the purpose, philosophy, and roadmap of em-control-tower.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] A `docs/vision.md` file exists describing:
  - Why the project exists (AI-era code review challenge)
  - Core philosophy (Radical Candor, data-informed feedback)
  - Feature areas (delivery tracking, review quality, team insights, OKR engine)
  - Guiding principles (data informs, privacy by default, start small)
  - Phased roadmap from Phase 0 to Phase 5
