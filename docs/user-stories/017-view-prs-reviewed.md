# US-017: View PRs Reviewed per Team Member

**Phase:** 1 — GitHub Integration
**Status:** Todo

## Story

As an engineering manager, I want to see how many PRs each team member reviewed over a given period so that I can identify review load imbalances.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] The dashboard shows a count of PRs reviewed per team member for the selected period
- [ ] "Reviewed" means the member submitted at least one review (APPROVED, CHANGES_REQUESTED, or COMMENTED)
- [ ] The chart/table allows comparison across the team
