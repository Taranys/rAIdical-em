# US-016: View PR Size per Team Member

**Phase:** 1 — GitHub Integration
**Status:** Todo

## Story

As an engineering manager, I want to see the average PR size (lines added/removed) per team member so that I can spot overly large PRs and encourage smaller, reviewable changes.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] The dashboard shows average additions and deletions per PR, per team member
- [ ] A visual indicator (e.g., color coding) highlights PRs above a configurable threshold (default: 500 lines)
- [ ] Clicking a team member drills down to their individual PR list with sizes
