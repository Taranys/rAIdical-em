# US-009: View Team Member List

**Phase:** 1 — GitHub Integration
**Status:** Todo

## Story

As an engineering manager, I want to see all my tracked team members at a glance so that I know who is being monitored.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] The `/team` page shows a table/grid with: avatar, display name, GitHub username, date added
- [ ] The list is sorted alphabetically by display name
- [ ] If no members are added, a helpful empty state is shown with a prompt to add members

## Dependencies

- [US-007: Add a Team Member](007-add-team-member.md) — the add member form and team page must exist
