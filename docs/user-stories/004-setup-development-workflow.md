# US-004: Set Up Development Workflow

**Phase:** 0 — Project Setup
**Status:** Done

## Story

As a contributor (human or AI), I want documented conventions and guidelines so that all contributions follow a consistent structure.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `CLAUDE.md` exists at project root with:
  - Project overview
  - Tech stack summary
  - Common commands
  - Project structure description
  - Key conventions (Server Components default, DB access rules, import aliases)
- [ ] Plan management convention defined (`docs/plan/` and `docs/plan_finished/`)
- [ ] User story convention defined (`docs/user-stories/`)
- [ ] `.gitignore` correctly excludes `node_modules/`, `data/`, `drizzle/`, `.env*`, `.next/`
- [ ] `README.md` with quick-start instructions
