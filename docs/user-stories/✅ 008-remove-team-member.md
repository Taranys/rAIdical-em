# US-008: Remove a Team Member

**Phase:** 1 — GitHub Integration
**Status:** Done

## Story

As an engineering manager, I want to remove a team member from the tracked list so that I can keep the team roster up to date.

## Dependencies

- ✅ [US-007: Add a Team Member](✅%20007-add-team-member.md) — team members must exist before they can be removed

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Each team member row has a "Remove" action
- [x] A confirmation dialog appears before deletion
- [x] Removing a member does not delete their historical PR/review data (soft removal — data is retained for historical metrics)

## Plan and implementation details

_To be filled before implementation._
