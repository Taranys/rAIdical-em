# US-019: Dashboard Period Selector

**Phase:** 1 — GitHub Integration
**Status:** Todo

## Story

As an engineering manager, I want to filter all dashboard metrics by a time period so that I can compare trends across sprints or quarters.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] A global date range selector at the top of the dashboard applies to all metric cards
- [ ] Preset options: last 7 days, last 14 days, last 30 days, last 90 days, custom range
- [ ] The selected period persists during the session (not across page reloads)
