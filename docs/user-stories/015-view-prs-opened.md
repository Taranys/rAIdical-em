# US-015: View PRs Opened per Team Member

**Phase:** 1 — GitHub Integration
**Status:** Todo

## Story

As an engineering manager, I want to see how many PRs each team member opened over a given period so that I can understand individual throughput.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] The dashboard (`/dashboard` or `/`) shows a bar chart or table of PRs opened per team member
- [ ] A date range picker allows filtering (e.g., last 7 days, last 30 days, custom range)
- [ ] Only PRs authored by tracked team members are counted
