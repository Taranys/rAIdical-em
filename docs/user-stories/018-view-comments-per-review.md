# US-018: View Comments per Review per Team Member

**Phase:** 1 — GitHub Integration
**Status:** Todo

## Story

As an engineering manager, I want to see the average number of review comments each team member leaves per PR reviewed so that I can gauge review depth.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] The dashboard shows average comments per review, per team member
- [ ] Only review comments (not general PR comments) are counted
- [ ] A low average could indicate rubber-stamping; a high average could indicate thoroughness — both are surfaced without judgment (data informs, humans decide)
